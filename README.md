ArtIntellect


A decentralized protocol on Andromeda that transforms Intellectual Property into a liquid, investable asset class.

ArtIntellect leverages AI and DeFi primitives to unlock the true value of creativity, enabling creators to tokenize, value, fractionalize, and trade their intellectual property (IP) seamlessly on the Andromeda blockchain.

The Challenge for Modern Creators

Creators and innovators face significant barriers in leveraging their most valuable assets:





üîí Illiquid Assets: Future royalties from music, books, or patents are valuable but locked up and hard to access for upfront capital.



ü§î Opaque Valuation: Determining a fair, data-driven market price for new IP is complex and often relies on guesswork.



üí∏ Complex Revenue: Royalty collection and distribution is slow, inefficient, and lacks transparency for stakeholders.

The ArtIntellect Solution

ArtIntellect provides a seamless, automated flow from creation to monetization, powered by Andromeda's DeFi infrastructure:





Tokenize IP: Creators register their IP (music, books, patents, etc.) on ArtIntellect, minting a unique CW721 token (NFT) on the Andromeda blockchain to represent undisputed ownership and origin of master rights.



AI Valuation: Our integrated AI oracle analyzes market trends, genre popularity, social media sentiment, and historical performance to provide a transparent, data-driven valuation and predict future revenue potential.



Fractionalize: Based on the AI valuation, creators can fractionalize a portion of their IP's royalty stream into CW20 tokens (royalty shares), offered to fans and investors via a Crowdfund ADO for capital raising.



Automate & Trade: Royalties are automatically distributed to creators and token holders via a Splitter ADO. Fractional tokens can be traded on an integrated Marketplace or in AMM pools, creating a liquid secondary market.
